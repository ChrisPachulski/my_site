  ### I create impactful data solutions that drive smart business decisions.

  I thrive at the intersection of analytics, automation, and storytelling, collaborating closely with stakeholders and engineering teams to build intuitive dashboards, automate workflows, and optimize digital marketing performance.

  My experience spans across financial services, digital marketing, consumer packaged goods, and technology industries, leveraging my skills in SQL, R, Python, and tools like Looker and Docker to enhance decision-making processes. I'm dedicated to continual improvement and delivering actionable insights.

  Outside of crunching numbers and optimizing data pipelines, I enjoy spending quality time with my daughter and our three dachshunds, watching the Toronto Maple Leafs let me down each year, and tinkering with Magic the Gathering collections.
